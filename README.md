# e-PostAPP-2.0

Project title: e-post app improved(ePost App 2.0)

Description:
ePost App 2.0 is designed as a improvement over the existing ChongWha Post App. Main changes we made include changing
some less used or disliked functions and improve or replace them, change the login and security system for easier use.
Although we say it is a improved version but that is an ambitious thought since we haved not tested it on others yet 
nor have we finished the prototype. The project is designed in UML and uses HTML and PHP.

The project is organized in the following folders:

1.ideation
by looking at some user feedback through multiple platforms(App store, Apple store, PTT), we see many people aren't
happy with the current version so we decided to change it, then we first came up with a improved version of the 
login system.

2.UML design
the folder contains diagrams of most of the functions we wish the app has, for this project we currently focus
more on three functions: login system, cash transfer, Bitcoin transaction.

3.Final presentation
Since we do not know how to create an App, we decided to use HTML and PHP to create some simple demonstrations of
our improved design, we tried making the web pages mobile compatible but ultimately failed since we never learned
this type of coding.

*we do not have a demonstration video,sorry.

4.Code
Use WAMP to open the login.php file and start from there, the default password 123 the username doesn't matter.
Be aware,only the transaction function in the interface.

5.Bugs and future improvements
This project is nowhere near complete, the other functions require coding, it needs to be made into an actual App
as well, and we require actual testing to know whether it is an improvement or not.
